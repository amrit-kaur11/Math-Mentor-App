# Probability Basics

Probability measures the likelihood of an event.

$$
P(E) = \frac{\text{Favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}
$$

## 1. Complement Rule

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$

---

## 2. Addition Rule

If A and B are mutually exclusive:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

---

## 3. Multiplication Rule

If A and B are independent:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$

---

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting total sample space
- Mixing independent and dependent events
