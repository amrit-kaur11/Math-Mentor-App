# Exponents and Laws of Powers

An exponent represents repeated multiplication.

If:

$$
a^n
$$

It means:
$$
a \times a \times a \dots (n \text{ times})
$$

---

## 1. Product Rule

If the bases are the same:

$$
a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}
$$

Example:
$$
x^2 \times x^3 = x^5
$$

---

## 2. Quotient Rule

$$
\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}
$$

Example:
$$
\frac{x^5}{x^2} = x^3
$$

---

## 3. Power of a Power

$$
(a^m)^n = a^{mn}
$$

Example:
$$
(x^2)^3 = x^6
$$

---

## 4. Power of a Product

$$
(ab)^n = a^n b^n
$$

Example:
$$
(2x)^3 = 8x^3
$$

---

## 5. Zero Exponent Rule

$$
a^0 = 1 \quad (a \neq 0)
$$

---

## 6. Negative Exponent Rule

$$
a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}
$$

Example:
$$
x^{-2} = \frac{1}{x^2}
$$

---

## 7. Special Cases

- \(1^n = 1\)
- \(0^n = 0\) (for n > 0)

---

## 8. Common Mistakes

- Adding exponents when bases are different (incorrect)
- Forgetting to subtract in division
- Ignoring negative exponent rule
- Confusing multiplication with power

---

## 9. When to Use Exponent Laws

Use these laws when:
- Simplifying algebraic expressions
- Solving equations involving powers
- Reducing fractions with variables
