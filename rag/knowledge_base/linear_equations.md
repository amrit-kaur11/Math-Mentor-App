# Linear Equations in One Variable

A linear equation in one variable has the general form:

$$
ax + b = c
$$

Where:
- \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants
- \(x\) is the variable

---

## 1. Steps to Solve a Linear Equation

To solve:

$$
ax + b = c
$$

Step 1: Subtract \(b\) from both sides  
$$
ax = c - b
$$

Step 2: Divide both sides by \(a\)  
$$
x = \frac{c - b}{a}
$$

## 2. Example 1

Solve:

$$
2x + 3 = 7
$$

Step 1:
$$
2x = 7 - 3
$$

Step 2:
$$
2x = 4
$$

Step 3:
$$
x = 2
$$

---

## 3. Example 2

Solve:

$$
5x - 10 = 0
$$

Step 1:
$$
5x = 10
$$

Step 2:
$$
x = 2
$$

## 4. Equations with Variables on Both Sides

Example:

$$
3x + 4 = x + 10
$$

Step 1: Bring variables to one side  
$$
3x - x = 10 - 4
$$

Step 2:
$$
2x = 6
$$

Step 3:
$$
x = 3
$$

---

## 5. Important Rules

- Always perform the same operation on both sides.
- Move constants to one side.
- Move variables to the other side.
- Simplify before dividing.

---

## 6. Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to change sign when moving terms.
- Dividing only one term instead of the entire equation.
- Incorrect subtraction.

---

## 7. When to Use Linear Equation Method

Use this method when:
- The highest power of the variable is 1.
- There is only one variable.
- The equation is not quadratic.
