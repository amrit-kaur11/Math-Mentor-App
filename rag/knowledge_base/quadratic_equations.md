# Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2.

General form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

Where:
- \(a \neq 0\)
- \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) are constants
- \(x\) is the variable

## 1. Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations

There are three main methods:

1. Factorization
2. Completing the Square
3. Quadratic Formula

---

## 2. Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

The expression inside the square root:

$$
D = b^2 - 4ac
$$

is called the **Discriminant**.

---

## 3. Nature of Roots (Using Discriminant)

If:

- \(D > 0\) → Two distinct real roots  
- \(D = 0\) → One real repeated root  
- \(D < 0\) → No real roots  

---

## 4. Example Using Quadratic Formula

Solve:

$$
x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
$$

Step 1:
- \(a = 1\)
- \(b = 5\)
- \(c = 6\)

Step 2:
$$
D = b^2 - 4ac
$$

$$
D = 25 - 24 = 1
$$

Step 3:
$$
x = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{2}
$$

Solutions:
$$
x = -2, -3
$$

---

## 5. Factorization Method

If the quadratic can be written as:

$$
x^2 + 5x + 6
$$

Find two numbers that:
- Multiply to 6
- Add to 5

Those numbers are 2 and 3.

So:

$$
(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
$$

---

## 6. Common Mistakes

- Forgetting ± sign
- Incorrect discriminant calculation
- Sign errors
- Dividing by wrong value of \(2a\)

---

## 7. When to Use Each Method

- Use factorization if numbers are simple.
- Use quadratic formula if factorization is difficult.
- Completing square for theoretical derivations.
