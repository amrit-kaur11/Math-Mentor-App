# Algebraic Identities 

Algebraic identities are standard formulas used to expand or factor expressions.

---

## 1. Square of a Sum

$$
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

Used when expanding expressions like:

$$
(x + 3)^2
$$

---

## 2. Square of a Difference

$$
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
$$

Important:
Be careful with the negative sign.

---

## 3. Difference of Squares

$$
(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2
$$

Example:
$$
(5 + 2)(5 - 2) = 25 - 4 = 21
$$

---

## 4. Product of Two Binomials

$$
(x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab
$$

Example:
$$
(x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 5x + 6
$$

---

## 5. Expansion of (a + b + c)^2

$$
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca
$$

---

## 6. Cube of a Sum

$$
(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3
$$

---

## 7. Cube of a Difference

$$
(a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3
$$

---

## 8. Factorization Using Identities

### If expression matches:
$$
x^2 + 5x + 6
$$

We try:
$$
(x + 2)(x + 3)
$$

because:
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 2 × 3 = 6

## 9. Common Mistakes

- Forgetting middle term (2ab)
- Sign errors in subtraction
- Confusing square with cube formulas
- Expanding incorrectly

## 10. When to Use Identities

Use algebraic identities when:
- Expanding brackets
- Simplifying expressions
- Factorizing quadratics
- Solving quadratic equations
